# DHS Sequence-Based Classification Using Interpretable Machine Learning

This project explores whether accessible DNA sequences (DNase I hypersensitive sites, or DHSs) can predict:
1. **Cell Type Identity** (e.g., GM12878, HepG2, K562, hESC)
2. **Cancer vs. Non-Cancer Phenotype**

We use k-mer frequency representations, GC content, and entropy as sequence features to train Random Forest classifiers. Performance is evaluated across a range of k-mer sizes (`k = 2,3,4,5,6,7,8`).

## 📥 Input FASTA Files

Each FASTA file contains DHS sequences from one cell line:
- `GM12878_DHS_sequences.fa`
- `hESCT0_DHS_sequences.fa`
- `HepG2_DHS_sequences.fa`
- `K562_DHS_sequences.fa`

Each sequence is 150–200 bp long and corresponds to an open chromatin region.

## ⚙️ Dependencies

## 🧪 Virtual Environment Setup (Recommended)

To isolate dependencies and avoid conflicts, use a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


To install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn biopython
```

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1️⃣ Run Cell Type Classifier (4-class classification)
```bash
python celltype_classifier.py
```

- Trains Random Forest on k-mer features
- Evaluates precision, recall, F1-score
- Saves confusion matrices & ROC curves per `k`
- Exports `rocdata_celltype_k{k}.txt` and `auc_celltype.txt`

---

### 2️⃣ Run Cancer vs Non-Cancer Classifier (binary classification)
```bash
python cancer_classifier.py
```

- Maps GM12878, hESC → non-cancer (0), K562, HepG2 → cancer (1)
- Trains and evaluates across k-mer sizes
- Outputs confusion matrices, ROC plots
- Saves `rocdata_cancer_k{k}.txt` and `auc_cancer.txt`
